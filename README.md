# PRML Implementation
Implementation of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book.
This repo is used for study and hence all notebooks are self-contained (with minimal external dependency).
Note that this repo is still working in progress, cf. [Linear Basis Regression](Linear_basis_regression.ipynb) to see how it will be.
